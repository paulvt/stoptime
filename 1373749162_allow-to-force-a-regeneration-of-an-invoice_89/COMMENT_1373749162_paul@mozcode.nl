At the moment, once an invoice is generated, it cannot be regenerated as it
will always serve the existing file.  This is annoying if a mistake was made
that was corrected in StopTime but is not corrected in the existing files.
The only way to force a generation currently is to manyally remove the
files from public/invoices/.

Some kind of checkbox that will allow a forced regeneration would be nice.
